The judge will run the code against a set of test cases which is not available to the contestant.

In case the code uses more memory than that is specified, a \"Run Time error\" message will be displayed. If the code doesn't compile properly for the specified language a \"Compile Error\" message will be displayed. The points to every problem is calculated based on the time taken to solve that problem from the beginning of the contest with an additional 20 minutes penalty to every submission which is not accepted.

Unlike Railways, Seaways or Airways, Road transport is easily feasible by any common man. Yes, roads are the basic mode of transportation for all the people alike BUT....... Road transport also has its flaws, the biggest drawback-Road Traffics leading to accidents and others fatalities. No proper management of traffics and partly due to human negligence have lead to a rise in the scale of fatalities recently. We as engineers and the future of this country need to plan out and design systems so as to minimise these fatalities and reduce the prevailing problem of traffics, because now it has become a challenge and a topic that has reached the stared points of the priority list of national problems and find solutions to these problems for a better tomorrow.

Unlike Railways, Seaways or Airways, Road transport is easily feasible by any common man. Yes, roads are the basic mode of transportation for all the people alike BUT....... Road transport also has its flaws, the biggest drawback-Road Traffics leading to accidents and others fatalities. No proper management of traffics and partly due to human negligence have lead to a rise in the scale of fatalities recently. We as engineers and the future of this country need to plan out and design systems so as to minimise these fatalities and reduce the prevailing problem of traffics, because now it has become a challenge and a topic that has reached the stared points of the priority list of national problems and find solutions to these problems for a better tomorrow. SO..... In short the theme for this year's SCDC is Road Transportation Safety and Precautions!!!!! ",

With solely the knowledge of facts, and no connections between them, the facts are quite ineffective. It is after connecting the dots, stringing the facts, gluing together the pieces that science begins to take place. This is where reason comes in. It is through research that one can reason out and put together the puzzled pieces. The true goal of all scientific research is to contribute to the consensus of universally accepted knowledge. This year at Shaastra 2015, we invite you all to come and communicate your findings and make them practicable, because we strongly believe \"Men perish, nations rise and fall but an idea lives on.

It is widely used process simulator in various chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining, polymer and coal based plants. Programming software can be used for solve model structures of chemical process with a small number of equations. However, as the complexity of the model structure increases by the addition of several processes, solving large set of equations becomes challenge. ASPEN plus comes handy while dealing with these situations.

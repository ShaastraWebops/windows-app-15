Under this broad umbrella topic, we would be discussing the influence technology and big data have on healthcare, the policy changes India would need to implement in order to improve the healthcare scenario and the large widening disparity that exists in the healthcare industry today. The symposium would include keynote speeches by industry leaders, a case study competition with prizes upto Rs. 60,000, mentoring sessions for intense debate and discussion on both tracks - Health Technology and Health Policy and a field trip to sensitize the participants towards the challenges rural India faces with respect to healthcare. In addition to the huge cultural exchange between the international and Indian students and the tremendous learning curve made possible due to a diverse set of participants, the IITM Symposium promises to be a great experience for all. Join us this January and be part of our symposium! "
